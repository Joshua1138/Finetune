This code repository contains the last 2 checkpoints made during training, the training and generation files. The model itself is 4,7 gigabytes and thus too large for GitHub. If necessary i can provide a google drive link to the trained model. The generation file asks for a system prompt first, where you can tell the generator to act like whatever the scenario would ask for. After this you can initiate the conversation.
